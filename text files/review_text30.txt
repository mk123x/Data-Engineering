Review:
I have numerous Apple devices, including computers, iPads, phones, and an iPod. While Apple products tend to be very reliable, that reliability becomes an issue as they age. Once a device is older than seven years, itâ€™s hard to get parts like batteries or service. Apple could improve by supporting older products for longer instead of just discontinuing parts and services. Not everyone wants or needs the latest model, and it would be great if Apple made an effort to support their older devices for longer.
