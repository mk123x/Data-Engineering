Review:
Shame Apple uses DPD
Apple are fast to deliver a product
and Apple are reliable however; the product
leaves Apple no problem. The problem
occurs when Apple sadly use the absolute
abomination that is the DPD courier service.
“The parcel keepers” I like to call them.
I had a keyboard coming to me today and
the delivery window was between 10:20
and 11:20 am. No problem. I was sat by my
window for an hour waiting; (because I know
what these couriers are like). So I waited and
it got to about 10:41 am when my phone alerted me. It was DPD. “Sorry we missed you.” No card left because the driver didn’t
even drive down my street. He couldn’t be bothered.

So because of this I will NEVER use Apple Store online ever again - until they change their courier service. What a let down. I decided to call Apple but for some weird reason they couldn’t find my item on the system as the system was down. So I’ll be seeking a refund and sending the item back to Apple. If DPD can manage to send it back. Maybe throw them a map or something…
