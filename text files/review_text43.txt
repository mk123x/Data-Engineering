Review:
Very poor customer service at reading Apple shop
I visited the Apple Store in Reading this evening and was thoroughly disappointed by the poor quality of staff attendance. Despite the store being moderately busy, I felt completely neglected.

When I finally managed to get someone's attention, the assistance I received was lackluster at best. The staff member was dismissive of my questions and provided minimal help, making me feel like I was an inconvenience rather than a valued customer.

For a brand that prides itself on exceptional customer service, this experience was far below expectations. I hope the management addresses these issues to improve the overall customer experience.
