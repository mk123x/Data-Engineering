Review:
One year ago, I went to the Apple Store to change the battery and I haven’t used the iPhone since! On 02.11.2024, I booked an appointment for camera repair because both cameras weren’t working. When I went to the Apple Store, the technician checked my iPhone 6 Plus and found that the cameras were broken after they had changed the battery! They offered me a £100 discount if I bought a new iPhone, but I don’t need a new iPhone right now as I have a Samsung 24 Ultra. I asked for a voucher, but they refused to give me one. Where is my compensation for the damage they caused? I will never buy an iPhone again because of this incident!
