Review:
After three months of ownership, my keyboard/trackpad failed. The lady in store saw the error and ran a keyboard test, which showed the control key had failed. She wrote a comprehensive explanation of the fault and had it sent away for repair. I was unable to work for three days, and then the MacBook was returned to me. According to the form, the MacBook had passed all testing, and the fault couldn’t be replicated. Within five minutes of use, the MacBook wasn’t working again and now needs to be sent back in for repair. This has financial implications for me, which I explained, and was told to try to sell or trade in the computer. Lazy repair service, a very poor product, and laughable customer service.
