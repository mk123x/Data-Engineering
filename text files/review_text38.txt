Review:
Buy online
Went to the Apple Store in Belfast to get my phone fixed with the same faulty in just over a year. When I returned to collect it later that day my son spoke to a member of staff and said that he wanted to purchase an Apple Watch. He was asked if he had made an appointment to buy one. He said that he hadn’t only to be told I would have to wait 15 minutes as he hadn’t made an appointment. I also spoke to the same individual to collect my phone and asked why do I have to wait to spend money to be told that’s how it is. I said that I think that I’ll would be better buying it online to be told ok. While I waited for my phone I watched a number of staff standing around talking to each other. Only my son was with me and really wanted the watch which I had promised I would get him that day I would have left. I pointed out the staff members doing nothing when my phone was brought out to be told yea we all wear the same uniform but perhaps we all have different jobs, which was a pretty poor excuse. So if you have money to spend, don’t spend it here! Buy it online. The popular stock in store is limited anyway and the delivery time to the shop is the same as to your home. Total waste of time visiting the store if you can only make a purchase by walking in off the street, (bizarre business model)!!!
