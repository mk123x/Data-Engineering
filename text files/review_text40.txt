Review:
Terrible company for customers
Where to start.

Apple TV - seriously, the quantity of shows is low, but in fairness, those you have a decent quality (of those I like anyway). We have the latest Apple box after the old one died, but the software is appalling since the last update, constantly crashes, freezes up and has conflicts with other apps on the box - most notable NowTV and Discover+, but it struggles with YouTube too now too.

The is a constant problem with constant updates - we are no guinee pigs to be used to find out what does and does not work - I am really getting fed up of having to restart the box to change a bloody program that is on a seperate App.

Also, stop attempting to charge me for paid content because its via the Apple box - I have an account with Prime - you will not charge me extra for paying to watch a film - thankfull I have found a way around your scam - trust me, it is a scam.

iPhone - convinced to get one about 2 years ago - I had been Android for almost well over a decade - No, just No - I will not be replacing it with another iPhone, it will be an Andoid - you cannot even make it work with well establish apps FFS - you mess about with Amazon, with Kindle etc - because you have the sheer arrogance and audacity to think because I am buying something on MY phone that you have the right to charge a fee - You know what you can do with that thought process - believe me, the sun will only shine there if you are buried face down.

My next TV will be a Smart TV, one where I do not need the AppleTV box, I will use AppleTV, but via the App on the TV, as with the others, so I do not have the nonsense of Apple as a company.

Look, you make good quality products, but your restrictive use practices are appalling, charging people because they use your product/platform to buy stuff from third party vendors is borderline criminal - its like Ford demanding we only put BP fuel in our Car. Try being human for a change, try HELPING your customers and users have a better and more enjoyable experience ans top ripping them off.
