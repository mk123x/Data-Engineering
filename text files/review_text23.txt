Review:
I would be more inclined to visit an Apple store more often if you weren't treated as either dumb or a potential criminal or both. I had an appointment to swap out an iPod and was greeted at the door by a green T-shirted female who asked me what I was doing there and then proceeded to tell me that they don't sell iPods anymore. I told her I knew that and there was an item waiting for me to swap over, but I could see she didn't believe me. Reluctantly she found my name on her iPad and handed me over to another consultant who swapped the iPod out but before you say, 'Could I have some information on iPhones,' she'd scurried off into the back of the store. The cult of Apple is not for me, I think.
