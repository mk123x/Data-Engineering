Review:
I was disappointed with my new iPhone 14 Pro. The transfer from my iPhone X caused multiple issues, and the battery life was awful. Even after updating to the latest software, the battery drained quickly, and I couldn't use the phone outside the house without it dying. Apple’s diagnostics didn’t identify any faults, but the poor battery performance persisted. I’m considering returning it unless they fix this issue.
