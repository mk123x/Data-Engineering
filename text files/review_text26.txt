Review:
Worst tech company with substandard products that don't last long, and you are bullied into buying new items in the name of upgrades. Customer service, especially at the Kingston Bentall Centre, is awful. The manager, Annmarie, was rude and unhelpful, and the staff is unprofessional and unqualified for the job. Apple is on the brink of being a scam waiting to happen.
