Review:
The process was slow...over a week of calls, during which I spoke to 5 different people. I was promised something and then a few days later they went back on their word. Nobody from Apple even had the courage to call/email to let me know...I only found out they rescinded on their promise when I called them to understand the status of the delivery. The service you expect from a big corporation with little regard for long-term customers.
