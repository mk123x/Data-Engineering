Review:
When I got my phone stolen, I went to the Apple Store at Stratford in Westfield Shopping Centre. The team was incredibly supportive, especially after hearing about my situation. They patiently helped me choose a new phone, answered all my questions, and even shared stories to make me feel better. The service was excellent, and they went out of their way to make sure I was comfortable throughout the process. The staff were professional and kind, and I truly appreciated their empathy and assistance. Thank you for making an awful situation better!
