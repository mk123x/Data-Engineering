Apple's customer support was fantastic! I needed help resetting my phone to prepare it for sale, and their team was incredibly patient and supportive. They assisted me for hours through both phone and text, ensuring everything was done correctly. I'm grateful for their service, and while I’m parting with my iPhone X, I’m thankful for such amazing customer care.
