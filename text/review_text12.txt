Review:
Went to Apple Store Trafford Centre to purchase a new Apple Watch and a new phone. We were guided through all the different phones and watches by Amy, one of the store team members. She was excellent and pleasant, understanding our needs. She took the time to explain everything and helped with the setup. Thank you, Amy, for flying the flag for Apple in the Trafford Centre.
