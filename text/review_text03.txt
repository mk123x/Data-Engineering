Review:
I had a very poor service in Leeds stores. The person from whom I bought the iPhone was indifferent and was not interested in explaining or selling the product. We are not techno-savvy. The staff at Apple stores know that they can get away with anything as their products are well sought after. I bought an iPad in the States and the experience there was totally different. They were very friendly and courteous! Recently my wife bought an iPhone from John Lewis, I wish I should have bought mine there as well. What we need is a human touch, which is lacking in Apple Stores.
