Review:
Apple Kingston Bentall Centre has the worst customer service. Manager Ann-Marie was unhelpful, rude, and gave false information. Itâ€™s disappointing that such a big company, relying on customer loyalty, allows this kind of poor treatment. They could learn a lot from companies like Tesla and their approach to business.
