Review:
Battery Replacement for a 'landfill' iPhone
I had booked to have the battery on my iPhone SE with the Reading Apple Centre. When I arrived, they took one look at this iPhone, called it ‘vintage’ and said they wouldn’t touch it. Why? The iPhone itself is just under 6 years old. But that MODEL of iPhone was 1st released just under 8 years ago (in the USA) and was therefore obsolete. Great attitude for a caring, environmentally-friendly company.

But my thanks to Fone World nearby in Reading. They said: No problem. Can fit a new battery in 30 mins, for much less than Apple wanted to charge. And it isn't easy. Apple’s design for iPhones makes it difficult to replace the battery. They would rather you bought a new iPhone.

But the chap at Fone World did it. No need to go to an Apple Centre ever again. My thanks for permitting me to keep using my unmarked, perfectly-working 'landfill' iPhone for another few years.
