Review:
I stopped using Apple products halfway through my iPhone 4 experience and switched to Windows PCs and Android phones. After inheriting a MacBook Pro, I ran into issues and called Apple for help. The support was able to get me up and running with basic fixes, but I appreciate that Appleâ€™s support is much better than the help you'd get from companies like Asus or HP, who wouldn't offer such assistance.
