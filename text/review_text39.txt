Review:
Apple products are worthless junk.
I bought an Apple iPhone in March and then an Apple smart watch a few weeks after. Worse move I ever made, first the watch took weeks to pair with my phone, then after a month features started to stop working, like the sleep app, then the heart rate app, then the weather app and then all apps stopped working. I looked online and all the information on how to reset the watch did not relate to my watch. Now in September my phone is playing up. It started to freeze then over heat to the point where I have to put it down and wait for it to cool down. The predictive text keeps switching itself back on after I switch it off. My ring tone keeps reverting back to the basic/factory set tone as well as all other alerts. I keep resetting them but the next day they are all changed again. I have searched for apple customer care and come up empty. Absolutely worthless, may as well get a carrier pigeon.
