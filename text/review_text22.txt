Review:
This is a review for the Apple Store in the Trafford Centre. Just want to say thank you to Sameer who literally is the best Apple customer adviser I have come across. He definitely needs a promotion to a more senior role. His emotional intelligence, listening skills, product knowledge, and general fun personality made me go ahead and purchase an iPhone 15 when really I was looking for a lower spec phone. I also went on to buy air pods, a charging plug, and a phone case. I traded in my old phone too, making a saving. Then Tom who helped me set up my phone was such a great staff member. Easy-going, a bit geeky, and again a high level of product knowledge. Had a great experience thanks to both advisers after a not so good one at EE across the way. Credit where credit is due!
