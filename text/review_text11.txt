Review:
No price match for the same product elsewhere. Apple Store in Bath, England. Showed staff 'cheaper in John Lewis' for an iPad but they refused to offer price match. We suggest buying cheaper from another outlet, you're still entitled to Apple store 'Genius Bar' and shop service if you have an Apple product and can go back there for ongoing support. They used to price match, it's a shame in this competitive market Apple doesn't recognize the advantage of price matching from reputable stores. Store manager at Apple in Bath said they no longer price match.
