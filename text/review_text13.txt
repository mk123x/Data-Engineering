Review:
I stopped using Apple products halfway through the iPhone 4's life, quite a few years ago. Since then, we have switched to Windows desktops and laptops and Android phones. After inheriting a MacBook Pro recently, I ran into problems and called Apple. The help offered over the phone helped me get it going (okay, fairly basic stuff). Try getting similar assistance with a PC laptop – you wouldn’t get any help from Asus or HP. Summarizing, Apple can be dreadfully arrogant at times (like all tech companies), but their online and phone support is good.
