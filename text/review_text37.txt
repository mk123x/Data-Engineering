Review:
RAMI WAS FANTASTIC
WE WENT TO THE APPLE STORE IN CARDIFF AND MET RAMI. SHE WAS CHEERFUL, LISTENED TO OUR PROBLEM, WHILE EXPLAINING THE TASKS THAT SHE WAS UP AGAINST. WHAT A JOY TO FIND SOMEONE WHO SO OBVIOUSLY UNDERSTANDS HER JOB, LOOKS LIKE SHE ENJOYS IT AND IS EFFICIENT. PEOPLE LIKE THIS ARE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN THESE DAYS. WELL DONE RAMI!!!
