Review:
I have lived in Poland, France, Australia, UK, and have bought items from Apple in the US as well. I have been a client for 10+ years. Wherever I went the customer service has been exceptional. People never tried to upsell me on anything, solved any problem I was up against. Yesterday, I got my Australia phone stolen in London, they spent over an hour to help me get a new phone and restore everything. The process wasn't easy but it was seamless and people made the biggest difference. Wherever I have been, the people Apple hires are all similar: smart, human-centric, kind, helpful, and friendly. Their recruitment is unparalleled. They have a customer for life.
