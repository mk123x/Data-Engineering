Review:
Horrendous service. NHS is far better than this company. Not a single emergency appointment for an urgent issue. Asked me to wait 4 days for an appointment - seriously Apple needs to understand the basic meaning of ‘Emergency’! And the staff - they think they employ us! First they have no clue about the service, then makeup excuses and finally make us angry! Apple should learn one thing - you are Customer based. I was waiting for iPhone 16, but you guys made me change from iPhone to Samsung after being Apple user since 2010!
