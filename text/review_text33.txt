Review:
After being overcharged for an iCloud subscription, I had a difficult time navigating Appleâ€™s customer service pages. It took several attempts to find the iCloud payment page, and while I eventually submitted a claim, Apple could improve the ease of navigating their support system. I hope they address this issue.
