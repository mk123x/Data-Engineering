Review:
My earpods, which are 2.5 years old, started making a horrible noise when playing music. I called Apple support, and they couldn’t have been more helpful. I tried all the fixes they recommended, but when they didn’t work, they sent me an envelope to send them in. I asked about the cost since they were out of warranty, and they assured me it should be covered. They wouldn't do any repairs if there was a cost without my approval. The next day, I received a prepaid box, sent them in, and they received them at 2:15 PM. The repairs were done by 8:30 PM, and they were dispatched back to me by 9:30 PM. They arrived at 9:15 AM the next morning, fully working, fully charged, and at no cost!
